The project illustrates the use of IOT in smart lighting of homes. A NODEMCU module is used to act as a server to which the mobile device 
is connected. The mobile app is built using simple UI, that allows users to control the intensity of light in 4 different rooms( 4 on board
LEDs), intensity altered using duty cycle of Pulse width modulation.
